# ai-monorepo

My ai-related monorepo to contain chat app and many api ai feature I can reuse across projects.
WIP stage, reimplementing from scratch a fully optimized llm chat web app inspired on t3.chat.
This starts from the rewrite of my participation to the t3.chat cloeathon.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Convex** - Database and AI agent framework
- **Clerk** - Authentication and user management (might change later though)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Before Deploying to Cloudflare

When you are ready to deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers, you'll have to make a couple changes.

- Change your url environment variables to match your `*.workers.dev` domains generated by Cloudflare:

```bash
# apps/web/.env
SERVER_URL={your-production-server-domain}

# apps/server/.env
CORS_ORIGIN={your-production-web-domain}
BETTER_AUTH_URL={your-production-server-domain}
```

- In `apps/server/src/lib/auth.ts`, uncomment the `session.cookieCache` and `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` sections and replace `<your-workers-subdomain>` with your actual workers subdomain. These settings are required to ensure cookies are transferred properly between your web and server domains.

## Deployment (Alchemy)

- Dev: pnpm dev
- Deploy: pnpm deploy
- Destroy: pnpm destroy
